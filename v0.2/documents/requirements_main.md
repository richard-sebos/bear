### Requirements Document for `main.py`

#### **Overview**
The `main.py` script is a command-line utility designed to validate and process various IP-related inputs, supporting different operational modes. This document outlines the functional, non-functional, and implementation requirements for the script.

---

### **Functional Requirements**

#### **1. Command-Line Arguments**

1. **`--ip`**
   - Accepts a single IP address as input.
   - Validates the IP address format using a dedicated validation class.
   - Outputs a message indicating whether the IP address is valid or invalid.

2. **`--cidr`**
   - Accepts an IP address and a CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).
   - Validates the IP address format and the correctness of the CIDR notation.
   - Reuses the validation class for IP address validation.

3. **`--list`**
   - Accepts a file containing a list of IP addresses (one IP per line).
   - Reads and processes the file using a file reader module.
   - Validates each IP address in the file using the same validation class.
   - Outputs a detailed report of valid and invalid IPs.

4. **`--help`**
   - Displays a concise yet informative usage guide for all options.
   - Includes examples of valid inputs for each argument.

5. **`--verbose`**
   - Provides detailed output during execution.
   - Useful for debugging or understanding the script's internal processing.

6. **`--quiet`**
   - Limits output to only essential messages, suppressing detailed logs.

#### **2. Additional Rules**

1. **Option Exclusivity**:
   - Options cannot be combined in a single execution. For example, `--ip` and `--list` cannot be used together.
   - If multiple options are provided, the script displays an error message and usage instructions.

2. **Output Requirement**:
   - At the end of each execution, the script creates a list of valid IPs.
   - This list is saved in a standardized format for potential future use with new modules.

3. **Strict Mode (Optional)**:
   - Supports an optional strict mode to perform deeper checks, including:
     - Validating IP reachability using ping.
     - Classifying IP addresses as public or private.

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Performance**:
   - Efficiently handle large files for the `--list` option, using batch processing or streaming if necessary.
   - Provide progress indicators for validating large input files.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Provide detailed and actionable error messages for invalid inputs, file paths, or malformed options.
   - Offer suggestions for correcting common errors.

3. **Logging**:
   - Implement configurable logging levels to support `--verbose` and `--quiet` options.
   - Logs should include timestamps, error details, and processing summaries.

4. **Extensibility**:
   - Use a modular architecture to easily integrate additional options or functionalities in the future.

5. **Compatibility**:
   - Ensure compatibility across major operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS).

### **Implementation Details**

1. **Modules**:
   - `validation_utils.py`:
     - Centralized logic for validating IP addresses and CIDR notations.
   - `file_reader.py`:
     - Handles reading and processing files for the `--list` option.
   
2. **Output**:
   - **For `--ip`**:
     - Outputs a message confirming whether the provided IP is valid.
   - **For `--cidr`**:
     - Outputs validation results for the IP and CIDR notation.
   - **For `--list`**:
     - Outputs a summary report of valid and invalid IPs.
     - Saves the valid IP list for future use.

3. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for individual validation functions.
   - Integration tests for all command-line options.
   - End-to-end tests to verify expected script behavior in real-world scenarios.

### **Future Enhancements**

1. **Integration with New Modules**:
   - The list of valid IPs created by the script will be passed to a new module in future iterations.

2. **Advanced Validation**:
   - Extend the validation class to include features like hostname resolution and subnet masking.

3. **Custom Output Formats**:
   - Support user-defined output formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) to facilitate integration with other tools.

---

### **Summary**
The `main.py` script provides robust functionality for processing and validating IP-related inputs. With a focus on modularity, extensibility, and performance, it ensures ease of use while laying the groundwork for future enhancements.
