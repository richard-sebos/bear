### **Requirements for Server Maintenance Report and Action Execution System**

#### **1. Objective**
Develop a new functionality to streamline the execution and tracking of server maintenance actions, ensuring that actions generate a detailed, customizable report and maintain a history of server statuses.

---

#### **2. Functional Requirements**

##### **2.1. Action Execution Enhancements**
- Actions should generate reports that:
  - Update a Markdown file specific to the target IP upon execution.
  - Include details such as:
    - Date and time of execution.
    - Name of the action executed.
    - Results of the action.

- **Action Script Requirements**:
  - Action scripts may include one or more actions.
  - Each action should be executed sequentially on the specified IP address.
  - The system should fetch required parameters (e.g., SSH ports) for the action from the Markdown file associated with the target IP.

- **Output Directory**:
  - Each IP address will have a corresponding file in the `notes` directory.
  - File names should combine the hostname and IP address (e.g., `hostname_IP.md`).

- **Input File**:
  - A file named `valid_ips.txt` in the output directory will contain a list of IPs to target.

- **Conditional Execution**:
  - Enable conditional execution within action scripts, allowing actions to be skipped based on criteria (e.g., IP reachability).

##### **2.2. Reporting Module**
- Add a `report` module with the following capabilities:
  - Parse IP-specific Markdown files in the `notes` directory to extract historical data.
  - Provide comparative analysis of results between runs, including:
    - Highlighting new additions in green (e.g., newly detected open ports).
    - Creating alerts for significant changes, such as:
      - An IP being down when previously it was up.
      - Differences in command outputs indicating environmental changes.

- **Customization**:
  - Users should be able to define new report actions tailored to specific needs.

- **Enhanced Insights**:
  - Include graphical representations (e.g., bar charts) for port availability or other trends.
  - Classify findings with severity levels (critical, warning, info).

- **Automation**:
  - Support scheduling periodic execution of actions and report generation.

##### **2.3. File Format**
- Files should:
  - Be in Markdown format for accessibility and editability.
  - Follow a standard structure with predefined sections for metadata, results, and logs.

##### **2.4. Alerting Mechanism**
- Integrate with alerting tools to notify users of:
  - Down IPs.
  - Major configuration changes detected in scans.

##### **2.5. Security**
- Encrypt Markdown files to protect sensitive information.
- Provide seamless decryption for reading and editing.

##### **2.6. Scalability**
- Support parallel processing or multi-threading to handle large numbers of IPs efficiently.

##### **2.7. Logging and Audit**
- Maintain detailed logs of actions executed, results generated, and modifications to ensure traceability.

##### **2.8. Documentation**
- Provide templates and sample files for valid IPs and Markdown notes to guide users.

#### **3. Non-Functional Requirements**

##### **3.1. Modularity and Extensibility**
- Implement a plugin-based architecture to allow dynamic addition of actions and reports without modifying the core system.

##### **3.2. Integration**
- Add API support for programmatic interaction with the system.
- Enable integration with CI/CD pipelines to automate action execution and reporting.

##### **3.3. Performance**
- Optimize for high performance, ensuring minimal latency even with large datasets.

##### **3.4. Testing**
- Include unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and robustness.

---

#### **4. Future Scope**
- Introduce AI-powered analysis for report insights.
- Develop a user interface for report visualization.
- Expand alerting integrations to include advanced tools like Slack, email, or webhooks.
- Support more sophisticated comparisons, such as trend detection over extended periods.
