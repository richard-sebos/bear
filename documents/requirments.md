#### **Requirements**
- **`main.py`**:
  - Orchestrates the flow of the application.
  - Delegates specific tasks like action loading and input validation to dedicated modules.
  - Parses command-line arguments:
    - `--ip`: Single IP.
    - `--cidr`: CIDR subnet size for an IP.
    - `--list`: File containing a list of IPs.
    - `--note-mode`: Enable notes mode.
  - Coordinates quick scans, detailed scans, and interactive sessions.
  - Updates a persistent file (`current_act_ip.txt`) with active IPs.
  - Supports a debug mode (`--debug`) for verbose logging.

---

### **2. Dynamic Action Loading**

#### **Requirements**
- **`action_loader.py`**:
  - Dynamically loads all action classes from the `actions/` directory.
  - Validates that all actions inherit from the `Action` base class.

---

### **3. Input Validation**

#### **Requirements**
- **`validation_utils.py`**:
  - Provides functions to validate IPs and CIDR ranges:
    - `is_valid_ip(ip)`: Check if a single IP or CIDR is valid.
    - `validate_targets(targets)`: Filter out invalid IPs/CIDRs from a list.
  - Handles user feedback for invalid entries.

---

### **4. Notes and Reporting**

#### **Requirements**
- **`NotesManager`**:
  - Manages Markdown-formatted notes for each IP.
  - Features:
    - **Add Entries**:
      - Timestamped entries for actions and results.
      - User-added notes.
    - **View Notes**:
      - Display notes for a specific IP.
    - **Edit Notes**:
      - Open notes for editing in `nano` or another user-configurable editor.
    - **Search Notes**:
      - Search through all notes for keywords or patterns.
    - **Global Notes Summary**:
      - Summarize all notes into a single Markdown file for quick review.
  - File naming:
    - Notes are stored in `notes/` with filenames like `192.168.1.1.md`.

---

### **5. Actions**

#### **Requirements**
- **`Action` Base Class**:
  - Define common methods (`execute`, `description`, `log`).
  - Inherit shared functionality (e.g., logging, note-taking).

#### **Derived Actions**:
- **`QuickAction`**:
  - Performs quick scans (e.g., `ping` or `nmap -sn`).
  - Logs results (`UP`, `REJECT`, `DOWN`) and updates notes if enabled.
- **`ScanAction`**:
  - Runs detailed port scans using `nmap`.
  - Logs open ports and detected services.
- **`VulAction`**:
  - Performs vulnerability scans using tools like `nmap` scripts or OpenVAS.
  - Logs and adds findings to notes.
- **`OsAction`**:
  - Detects the operating system of a target IP.
  - Adds OS details to notes.
- **`DosAction`**:
  - Runs Denial-of-Service tests using tools like Metasploit.
  - Logs results and appends to notes.

---

### **6. AI-Powered Reporting**

#### **Requirements**
- **Future Integration**:
  - Use AI to analyze notes for each IP and generate detailed, security-focused reports.
  - Include:
    - **Current Status**:
      - Open ports, detected services, vulnerabilities.
    - **Recommendations**:
      - Steps to mitigate risks or harden security.
  - Output reports in Markdown, PDF, or HTML.

#### **Report Manager**:
- A `ReportManager` class to:
  - Parse notes.
  - Generate reports for individual IPs or a global summary.

---

### **7. Logging Enhancements**

#### **Requirements**
- **Centralized Logging**:
  - Logs actions and results to:
    - A file (`bear_app.log`).
    - The `systemd` journal if available, using the `systemd-python` library.
  - Log format:
    ```plaintext
    UNIT=BEAR ACTION="scan" IP="192.168.1.1" STATE="UP" MESSAGE="Port scan completed."
    ```
- **Unified Logging and Notes Integration**:
  - Automatically append log entries to notes when `--note-mode` is enabled.
- **Real-Time Logging**:
  - Support viewing logs in real time (similar to `journalctl -f`).

---

### **8. Notes Mode**

#### **Requirements**
- **Core Features**:
  - Automatically log all actions performed on an IP into its notes file.
  - Allow users to view and edit notes directly.
  - Enable or disable notes mode via `--note-mode`.

---

### **9. Search and Summarization**

#### **Requirements**
- **Search Notes**:
  - Search notes for:
    - Keywords (e.g., `Critical`, `Public`).
    - Specific actions (e.g., `scan`, `vul`).
- **Summarize Notes**:
  - Generate a global summary of all notes in Markdown format.

---

### **10. Additional Features**

#### **Scheduled Scans**
- Schedule scans to run at specific intervals or times (e.g., `daily at 2am`).
- Use `crontab` or an internal scheduler.

#### **Continuous Monitoring**
- Add a "watch" mode to continuously monitor specific IPs or subnets and update notes in real time.

#### **Encryption for Notes**
- Encrypt notes to protect sensitive data using `cryptography`.

#### **Progress Indicators**
- Display progress bars for lengthy scans (e.g., using `tqdm`).

---

### **11. Testing and Debugging**

#### **Requirements**
- **Mock Scans**:
  - Implement mock scans for testing functionality without live networks.
- **Debug Mode**:
  - Add a `--debug` flag for verbose logs and error traces.

---

### **12. Modular and Extensible Design**

#### **Requirements**
- **Reusable Utilities**:
  - Centralize validation, logging, and note management.
- **Extensible Actions**:
  - Add new actions without modifying existing code (e.g., by inheriting from `Action`).

---

### **13. Performance Optimization**

#### **Requirements**
- **Parallel Scans**:
  - Use threading or async to scan multiple IPs or subnets simultaneously.
- **Caching**:
  - Cache results for previously scanned IPs to avoid redundant work.

---

### **14. External Dependencies**

#### **Python Libraries**
1. **Standard Libraries**:
   - `argparse`: Command-line argument parsing.
   - `os`: File and directory management.
   - `subprocess`: Running external commands.
   - `datetime`: Timestamp generation.
   - `socket`: Hostname resolution.

2. **Third-Party Libraries**:
   - `systemd-python`:
     - For advanced integration with `systemd` journal.
     - Install via `pip install systemd-python`.
   - `python-nmap`:
     - For interacting with `nmap` programmatically.
     - Install via `pip install python-nmap`.
   - `cryptography` (Future):
     - For encrypting notes files.
     - Install via `pip install cryptography`.
   - `tqdm` (Optional):
     - For progress bars.
     - Install via `pip install tqdm`.
